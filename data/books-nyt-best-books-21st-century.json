Not only male and female, but also real and imaginary, poetry and prose, living and dead. The way to be \u201cboth\u201d is to recognize the extent to which everything already is. \u2014 A.O.

It is a book supposedly about training a hawk named Mabel but really about wonder and loss, discovery and death. We discover a thing, then we lose it. The discovering and the losing are two halves of the same whole. Macdonald knows this and she shows us, weaving the loss of her father through the partial taming (and taming is always partial) of this hawk. \u2014 Tara Westover, author of \u201cEducated\u201d",

    "description": "There is nothing green or growing in McCarthy\u2019s masterpiece of dystopian fiction, the story of an unnamed man and his young son migrating over a newly post-apocalyptic earth where the only remaining life forms are desperate humans who have mostly descended into marauding cannibalism. Yet McCarthy renders his deathscape in curious, riveting detail punctuated by flashes of a lost world from the man\u2019s memory that become colorful myths for his son. In the end, \u201cThe Road\u201d is a paean to parental love:  A father nurtures and protects his child with ingenuity and tenderness, a triumph that feels redemptive even in a world without hope. \u2014 Jennifer Egan, author of \u201cA Visit From the Goon Squad\u201d",

    "description": "Having for decades cast a famously cool and implacable eye on everything from the Manson family to El Salvador, Didion suddenly found herself in a hellscape much closer to home: the abrupt death of her partner in life and art, John Gregory Dunne, even as their only child lay unconscious in a nearby hospital room. (That daughter, Quintana Roo, would be gone soon too, though her passing does not fall within these pages.) Dismantled by shock and grief, the patron saint of ruthless clarity did the only thing she could do: She wrote her way through it.",

The central plotline follows the nerdy, overweight Oscar de Le\u00f3n through childhood, college and a stint in the Dominican Republic, where he falls disastrously in love. Sharply rendered set pieces abound, but the real draw is the author\u2019s voice: brainy yet inviting, mordantly funny, sui generis.",

And also from the Book of Jeremiah, which names a place where healing may or may not be found: \u201cIs there no balm in Gilead?\u201d For John Ames, who narrates this novel, the answer seems to be yes. An elderly Congregationalist minister who has recently become a husband and father, he finds fulfillment in both vocation and family. Robinson allows him, and us, the full measure of his hard-earned joy, but she also has an acute sense of the reality of sin. If this book is a celebration of the quiet decency of small-town life (and mainline Protestantism) in the 1950s, it is equally an unsparing critique of how the moral fervor and religious vision of the abolitionist movement curdled, a century later, into complacency. \u2014 A.O.

Supervised by a group of \u201cguardians,\u201d the friends share music and rumors while navigating the shifting loyalties and heartbreaks of growing up. It\u2019s all achingly familiar \u2014 at times, even funny. But things begin to feel first off, then sinister and, ultimately, tragic.  As in so much of the best dystopian fiction, the power of \u201cNever Let Me Go\u201d to move and disturb arises from the persistence of human warmth in a chilly universe  \u2014 and in its ability to make us see ourselves through its uncanny mirror. Is Ishiguro commenting on biotechnology, reproductive science, the cognitive dissonance necessary for life under late-stage capitalism? He\u2019d never be so didactic as to tell you. What lies at the heart of this beautiful book is not social satire, but deep compassion.",

The book (published posthumously) is divided into five loosely conjoined sections, following characters who are drawn for varying reasons to the fictional Mexican city of Santa Teresa: a group of academics obsessed with an obscure novelist, a doddering philosophy professor, a lovelorn police officer and an American reporter investigating the serial murders of women in a case with echoes of the real-life femicide that has plagued Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. In Natasha Wimmer\u2019s spotless translation, Bola\u00f1o\u2019s novel is profound, mysterious, teeming and giddy: Reading it, you go from feeling like a tornado watcher to feeling swept up in the vortex, and finally suspect you might be the tornado yourself.",

The story, about a Midwestern matron named Enid Lambert who is determined to bring her three adult children home for what might be their father\u2019s last Christmas, touches on everything from yuppie excess to foodie culture to Eastern Europe\u2019s unbridled economy after the fall of communism \u2014 but it is held together, always, by family ties. The novel jumps deftly from character to character, and the reader\u2019s sympathies jump with it; in a novel as alert to human failings as this one is, it is to Franzen\u2019s enduring credit that his genuine affection for all of the characters shines through.",

When Henry becomes the proprietor of a plantation, with slaves of his own, the moral sands shift under the reader\u2019s feet. Grief piles upon grief.

This migration, she writes, \u201cwould become perhaps the biggest underreported story of the 20th century. It was vast. It was leaderless. It crept along so many thousands of currents over so long a stretch of time as to be difficult for the press truly to capture while it was under way.\u201d Wilkerson blends the stories of individual men and women with a masterful grasp of the big picture, and a great deal of literary finesse. \u201cThe Warmth of Other Suns\u201d reads like a novel. It bears down on the reader like a locomotive. \u2014 Dwight Garner",

From there the book (like the series as a whole) expands as propulsively as the early universe, encompassing ideas about art and politics, class and gender, philosophy and fate, all through a dedicated focus on the conflicted, competitive friendship between Elena and Lila as they grow into complicated adults. It\u2019s impossible to say how closely the series tracks the author\u2019s life \u2014 Ferrante writes under a pseudonym \u2014 but no matter: \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is entrenched as one of the premier examples of so-called autofiction, a category that has dominated the literature of the 21st century. Reading this uncompromising, unforgettable novel is like riding a bike on gravel: It\u2019s gritty and slippery and nerve-racking, all at the same time.",
