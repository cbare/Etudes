Initially banned in the United States but overturned by a legal challenge by Random House\u2019s Bennett Cerf, Ulysses was called \u201ca memorable catastrophe\u201d (Virginia Woolf), \u201ca book to which we are all indebted\u201d (T.

Forster considered it his \u201cnicest\u201d novel, and today it remains probably his most well liked. Its moral is utterly simple: Throw away your etiquette book and listen to your heart."

    "description": "Williams identified the United States as an imperial power long before such an argument was popular, and linked the U.S. history of expansionism to British political history\u2014a controversial and important argument in 1961.  For all its literary significance, the book is dense: one reviewer complained that Williams had \u201cproduced a volume so packed with erudite and obscure references and sesquipedalian words that it defeated one reader completely\u201d (Kirkus Reviews)."

    "description": "In 1959, Truman Capote read a 300-word article in The New York Times about the savage murder of an entire family. Intrigued, he traveled to Holcomb, Kansas, to investigate with his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee. As Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he writes with both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. In Cold Blood grew out of Capote\u2019s 8,000 pages of notes and interviews, and is the second-biggest-selling true crime book in publishing history."

    "description": "Statistics saturate our conversations, our news, and our governments\u2014but how, and why, did these numbers attain such outsize influence? Hacking argues that our belief in statistics reflects our attitudes toward randomness: Do we believe that randomness exists? Or do we believe that chance is merely ignorance of undiscovered laws of the universe? Although this book may not be for everyone, it did earn rave reviews from the American Historical Review and the Journal of the American Statistical Association (\u201cvery pleasant reading\u201d). A book that has shaped how we talk about probability and our attitudes toward science."
