The Sultan's Riddle

source: https://explainextended.com/2016/12/31/happy-new-year-8/

Once upon a time there was a Sultan who was looking for a vizier to help him
rule his country. It became known to him that among the multitudes of his loyal
subjects that populated his glorious empire, two were regarded as the most wise
and sharp in mind. Their names were Ali-ibn-Wali and Wali-ibn-Ali. The Sultan
summoned the men to his palace and ordered them to stand in front of him.

"It has come to my attention that you, Ali, and you, Wali, are the smartest men
of all the people of Faith. Is that right?", asked the Sultan, sipping his
sharbat. "We do know a thing or two of the beasts of the land and the fish of
the sea and stars of the sky, indeed, but your sheer wisdom, o Great Sultan,
outshines whatever puny bits of knowledge we might have and makes words coming
from our mouths sound like child's babbling", said the wise men, kneeling
before the Sultan (as they were truly wise and knew how to talk to a man of
high power).

"Good, good," said the Sultan with a sneer, "I see you are good with words but
are you as good with numbers? Let me test your knowledge."

"A diviner once came to my palace and revealed two numbers to me," continued
the Sultan, "one being my lucky number, and another one being my unlucky
number. Each of these numbers is more than one and less than a hundred. I
never tell these numbers to anyone as this could put the fate of my empire in
enemy's hands. But I am going to multiply those numbers and secretly tell their
product to you, Ali, and then I am going to add those numbers and secretly tell
their sum to you, Wali. If you are as wise as they say, you will have no
problem figuring out those numbers."

And then he ordered the men to approach him and kneel before him, and he
whispered the numbers to their ears.

Once Ali raised from his knees, he stood there for a moment, silently moving
his lips, and then said: "Unfortunately, Ð¾ the Brightest One, I cannot tell you
those numbers."

"This is true," confirmed Wali, stroking his beard.

"Thank you, most esteemed Wali," said Ali, his face brightening with joy. "Now
I can tell those numbers."

"Thank you too, most esteemed Ali," answered Wali. "Now I can tell them too."

And they whispered the numbers to the ear of the astonished Sultan, and they
turned out right. And they both were appointed viziers.

Can you tell those numbers?
